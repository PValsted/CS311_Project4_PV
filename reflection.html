                <li>Image on the menu bar at the top will not load despite me doing everything it says to do on the Bootstrap site. Solution: I found icons on Bootstrap's site and copied the code for the one I wanted and it loaded.</li>
                <li>A further solution to the above issue: I simply made a dumb mistake with syntax and included a / at the beginning of the link. This was solved later, but I kept the icon on top because I like it.</li>
                <li>When using grids in Bootstrap, the whole breakpoint system was hard to figure out. It caused the navbar to not align properly for example. Solution: figured out how to use container-fluid class</li>
                <li>When linking to my own external stylesheet, none of the attributes ever changed. I tried multiple things, including moving the reference under the Bootstrap reference and adding !important to the attributes in case they were being overridden, but none of this worked. Solution: I simply switched to internal CSS.</li>
                <li>Update to the above item: After some reflection, I finally figured out my issue, which was the same as the image issue caused by including an extra / at the beginning of the link. I linked my own stylesheet successfully but decided to keep the internal CSS for simplicity's sake just this time.</li>
                <li>One of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to best approach the outline of the composer pages using a grid, as the layout calls for multiple rows next to one row. There are likely plenty of ways, more efficient ways even, but I discovered you could nest rows within a column with Bootstrap so that's the solution I went with.</li>
                <li>In general, this project wasn't super challenging for me, but I did find I was super rusty on HTML and CSS. Because of this I suspect there are many things I could've done differently or more efficiently, and I need to refresh myself on it when I
                    have more time. As for Bootstrap, it seems a bit complex and maybe a bit intimidating, but the flipside is I can see how impressive the amount of stuff you can do with it is. It makes a lot of things I remember doing
                    with HTML a while back much simpler, and although it is nice to design everything manually, I enjoy the time saved and peace of mind using a framework gives me.
                </li>
                <li>The only outstanding issue I can really think of is the content of my introductory paragraph on my homepage. I didn't know what to say really, so in a final product, of course, it would be more fleshed out than a couple sentences.</li>
